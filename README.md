# kalman-trend-filtering

A small practice project exploring trend estimation in financial time series using a basic Kalman filter.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a practice-oriented exploration of trend estimation under noisy financial time series.  
The goal of the project is not return prediction or trading optimization, but to gain hands-on understanding of how a Kalman filter behaves when applied to price data under different modeling assumptions.

The project is designed as a learning exercise, with emphasis on transparency, interpretability, and controlled experimentation.

---

## What This Project Does

- Implements a one-dimensional Kalman filter for trend estimation from scratch.
- Uses synthetic data with a known underlying trend to verify estimation behavior.
- Examines how the process noise parameter affects smoothness and responsiveness of the estimated trend.
- Applies the same framework to real equity price data for qualitative inspection.

---

## What This Project Does Not Do

- This is not a trading strategy or alpha model.
- No portfolio construction, transaction costs, or performance optimization is considered.
- No claims are made regarding predictive power or investment value.

## Experiments

### 1. Synthetic Data

The Kalman filter is first applied to simulated price series with a known latent trend.  
This allows direct comparison between the estimated trend and the ground truth, and helps illustrate the bias–variance tradeoff induced by the process noise parameter.

### 2. Parameter Sensitivity

A small set of process noise values is tested to observe how trend estimates change under different assumptions.  
The results highlight the tradeoff between smoothness and responsiveness rather than identifying an “optimal” parameter.

### 3. Real Market Data

The model is applied to historical SPY price data.  
Since the true trend is unobservable, analysis focuses on qualitative consistency with the synthetic experiments rather than numerical accuracy.

---

## Limitations

- The model assumes linear Gaussian dynamics.
- Results are specific to the chosen setup and data.
- The analysis is illustrative rather than exhaustive.
